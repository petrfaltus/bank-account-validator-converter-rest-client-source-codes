# Bank account validator and converter REST client source codes
Small example console source codes for a validation and conversion of the bank account. It is the client that communicates using JSONs with my own bank account validation and conversion REST service.

## Running under Windows
1. clone this repository to your computer
2. build and run the example **Java** code

### 1. Cloning to your computer
- install [GIT] on your computer
- clone this repository to your computer by the GIT command
  `git clone https://github.com/petrfaltus/bank-account-validator-converter-rest-client-source-codes.git`

### 2. The Java client source code
- install [Java JDK] on your computer
- set the OS environment `%JAVA_HOME%` variable (must exist `"%JAVA_HOME%\bin\java.exe"`)

#### 2.1. Apache Maven
- install [Apache Maven] on your computer
- add the Maven directory (where the batch `mvn.cmd` locates) to the OS environment `%PATH%` variable

The subdirectory `java-maven` contains prepared Windows batches:
- `01-build.cmd` - cleans, compiles and builds the Maven project
- `02-run.cmd` - runs the built Java archive (JAR)
- `03-clean.cmd` - cleans the Maven project

#### 2.2. Gradle Build Tool
- install [Gradle Build Tool] on your computer
- add the Gradle directory (where the batch `gradle.bat` locates) to the OS environment `%PATH%` variable

The subdirectory `java-gradle` contains prepared Windows batches:
- `01-build.cmd` - cleans, compiles and builds the Gradle project
- `02-run.cmd` - runs the built Java archive (JAR)
- `03-clean.cmd` - cleans the Gradle project

Now in February 2021 I have the computer with **Windows 10 Pro 64bit**, **12GB RAM** and available **50GB free HDD space**
